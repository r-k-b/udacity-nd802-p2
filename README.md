# Instructions

## Project 2: [Public Transportation App](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd802/parts/8021345403/modules/550593026975462/lessons/5505930269239847/concepts/57997297480923)

Prepare for this project with [JavaScript Promises](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud898) and [Building Offline-First Apps.](https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899)


## Viewing this project

Run `npm start && npm serve`


## Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the
rubric below. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All
criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.


## Requirements

You must build an application that allows users to select a departure and
arrival train station, and see a list of trains, times, and durations.
Initially, the application should load a default train schedule - many
public transportation agencies offer this information via an API or as
a GTFS file (for example, [CalTrain](http://www.caltrain.com/developer.html)
or [the My511.org transit data feed](http://511.org/developer-resources_transit-data-feed.asp)).
If the application is online, your schedule should reflect the available
transit data, informing the user of relevant information; for example,
departure times and arrival times.

Review [the evaluation rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/5505930269/rubric)
for this project early and often.

### Completion

__Meets Specifications:__ App includes all requirements, including
departure and arrival times of trains.


### Responsiveness

__Meets Specifications:__ App is equally functional on mobile and desktop,
using responsive design to ensure its displayed in a usable state.


### Offline Functionality

__Meets Specifications:__ Application defaults to offline-first
functionality, functioning if a network connection does not exist.


### App Delivery

__Meets Specifications:__ App includes a build process (such as Grunt
or Gulp). Assets are minimized and concatenated as appropriate.
